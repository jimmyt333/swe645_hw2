	<p>SWE 645 covers some of the topics related to the software development models
	that are used to support component-based software systems. We will be
	studying the software design and development side of component-based
	software that includes design principles to architect resilient, highly available,
	performance oriented, and secure applications in AWS cloud. The course is
	designed to provide a rich full stack development comprising the development
	of both front end (client side) and back end(server side) portions of enterprise
	web applications.</p>
